        "# Q1. Explain the importance of Functions.\n",
        "\n",
        "# Ans. Functions are a fundamental concept in programming and play a vital role in writing efficient, maintainable, and reusable code.\n",
        "#  Here are some reasons why functions are important:\n",
        "\n",
        "# 1. Code Reusability-\n",
        "# Functions allow you to reuse code without having to rewrite it. Once a function is defined,\n",
        "# it can be called multiple times with different inputs, saving effort and reducing redundancy.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 2. Modularity-\n",
        "# Functions break down a program into smaller, manageable chunks. Each function handles a specific task,\n",
        "# making it easier to understand, debug, and maintain the code.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 3. Improved Readability-\n",
        "# By using functions with descriptive names, code becomes more self-explanatory. For example,\n",
        "# calculate_total() is easier to understand than a block of code that calculates the total.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 4. Avoiding Repetition (DRY Principle)-\n",
        "# Functions help adhere to the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle by consolidating repeated logic into a single place,\n",
        "# reducing errors and effort when updates are needed.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 5. Easier Debugging-\n",
        "# Since functions are self-contained units, debugging becomes more straightforward.\n",
        "# You can test each function individually to ensure its correctness.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 6. Scalability-\n",
        "# Functions make it easier to scale applications by enabling the integration of additional functionality.\n",
        "#  You can add more functions without affecting the existing ones significantly.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 7. Parameterization and Customization-\n",
        "# Functions accept parameters, allowing you to customize their behavior for specific use cases.\n",
        "# For instance, a sorting function can sort lists in ascending or descending order based on a parameter.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 8. Encapsulation-\n",
        "# Functions encapsulate logic and details, exposing only the necessary inputs and outputs.\n",
        "# This abstraction hides complexity and makes the code more modular.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 9. Facilitates Collaboration-\n",
        "# In team environments, functions allow different team members to work on separate parts of a program without interfering with each other's code.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 10. Improved Performance with Recursion-\n",
        "# Functions can call themselves (recursion) to solve complex problems like traversing trees or performing divide-and-conquer algorithms,\n",
        "# making them a powerful tool in problem-solving."

        "# Encapsulation is one of the fundamental principles of object-oriented programming (OOP).\n",
        "# It refers to the bundling of data (attributes) and the methods (functions) that operate on that data within a single unit, or class.\n",

        "\n",
        "# 3. Getters and Setters (Accessors and Mutators):  Instead of directly accessing private attributes, you usually provide public methods\n",

        "\n",
        "# 1. Data Hiding and Protection:  Encapsulation protects the internal state of an object from unauthorized access or modification.\n",
        "#  By making attributes private or protected, you control how external code can interact with the object, preventing accidental corruption of data.\n",
        "#   This enhances the integrity and reliability of your code.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 2. Abstraction: Encapsulation hides the internal complexity of an object from the outside world.\n",

        "#  don't necessarily affect how other parts of the code use the class, as long as the public interface remains the same.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 4. Code Maintainability: Encapsulation promotes code maintainability. If you need to modify the internal workings of a class,\n",
        "# you can do so without affecting code that uses the class, provided the public interface remains unchanged.\n",
